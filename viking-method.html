  <h1>Viking Method Guide: Mindset and Fitness</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>1. Mindset</h2>
    <p>To have the viking mindset, you need to stop resisting. Why? Because it is holding you back from achieving your goals. To stop resisting, write down what your goals are on a piece of paper. Now, no matter what, make sure you are fully dedicated to them. If you are asking yourself how to get the dedication, you don't care about your goals that much. Sometimes, you will feel like giving up, sometimes you will want to just quit, sometimes you will be unmotivated, but on the days where you will feel like that, work twice as hard. Despite what I've said, their is a good type of resistance, which is the resistance against temptation. You must build resistance to stop yourself from cheating on your diet, being lazy, scrolling on socials, gossiping, jealousness, lust, lying in general and getting drunk. Why? Because these are the things that are holding you back. How? Just think about it. These are all the things that are destroying your mental health.</p>
    <p>You need discipline to stop doing these things. You can build discipline by doing the following things:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Start having cold showers every morning</li>
        <li>Make your bed every morning</li>
        <li>Going to the gym</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of these have their own benefits as well. Cold showers boost testosterone, making your bed will just make you more disciplined as it is probably something you don't like doing, and going to the gym makes you more attractive. Cold showers and the gym make you more disciplined because both are painful. Nobody enjoys doing either of them. However, the primary way you will gain discipline is through resisting temptation. If cutting out all of those things, having cold showers every morning, making your bed every morning and working out regularly don't make you disciplined, I don't know what does. Discipline will help you do these things. You can start off with whatever tasks seem easiest and gradually go to the harder ones too.</p>
    <p>To do all this, not only will you need discipline, you will also need to be consistent. Follow a routine of your choice and wake up early so you have more time to be consistent throughout your day. If you stick to this, you will become more disciplined. The only thing you need to stay consistent is to stop procrastinating. To stop procrastinating, follow these instructions: start by slowly getting yourself ready for your task. Once you are done getting ready, do your task for 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break afterwards, and repeat until finished. Make sure you are always busy as well so you don't fall into temptation.</p>
