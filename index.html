    <h2>Start Your Journey Today</h2>
    <p>Congratulations! You finally decided to begin progressiving towards being the best version of yourself! You are already ahead of 90% of people. I am proud of you brother! Now, if you are actually willing to do this, remember; Discipline + Focus + Action = Success. These motivational videos on TikTok or whatever won't do anything, because motivation is useless and only tempoary. Anyways, I believe in you. Head on over to courses to begin your journey.</p>
    <p>Self improvement is a journey, however, their is no specific destination you are supposed to reach. You may reach check points, such as making a successful business or being able to bench a certain amount, but you gotta keep pushing forward and achieving even more. Make your business more successful, try to bench more the next time you go to the gym. Your life is always going to progress towards getting better and better. Also, if you fail to reach that check point, work out why you failed, try again if possible or move on to the next one.</p>
    <p>The journey is to help you improve yourself physically, mentally and financially. We will give you fitness and lifestyle advice as well.</p>
    <p>As my father once said:</p>
    <p>"Do not leave what you can do today until tomorrow"</p>
    <p>"If not now, when?"</p>
