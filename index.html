        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We are a self improvement website. Like our name says, we were made to help transform people's lives. Our goal is to do everything in our power to help people, like you, become the best version of themselves through our guides.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We want to help people improve themselves Physically, Mentally, Financially, Spiritually, etc. We are helping people break free from addictions, such as pornography, scrolling on social media, vaping and whatever is holding you back from achieving what you've dreamed for. As well as this, we want to bring positive change, such as the gym, a better diet, etc into your life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Transforming your life is a journey, but their isn't a destination you are supposed to reach. Instead, their are only check points. These check points include but are not limited to quitting an addiction, being able to lift a certain amount at the gym, starting a side hustle, getting a girlfriend, etc. Now, the reason their isn't a destination is because the journey doesn't have an end. You aren't going to quit the gym after you manage to bench 100kg, are you? Of course you wouldn't. You should try to do 110kg next time you go.</p>
