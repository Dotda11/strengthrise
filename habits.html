    <h1>How to Break Free From Bad Habits</h1>
    <h2>1. Stop Procrastinating</h2>
    <p>This is hands down the best way to stop being lazy, and I will teach you how to do it. First, I want you to think of 2 things; what are the things you're procrastinating about and why are you procrastinating over them? Knowing the root cause of the problem is always a significant advantage in solving it.</p>
    <p>Now, I want you to get the most important thing you're procrastinating about. I'm going to guess it's something large, like a school assignment. Now, I want you to break that task you've been procrastinating about into smaller steps. I'll give you a minute to work out how to break that task into smaller parts.</p>
    <p>Make realistic goals for the task you are doing. As I am using a school assignment as my example, my goals will be to write at least 600 words and 5 paragraphs.</p>
    <p>If these won't do the trick, I bet you the 2-minute rule will. Pretty much, tell yourself you're only doing your task for 2 minutes, set a timer for 2 minutes, and keep repeating until you have completed your task.</p>
    <p>Also, I don't care what your task is and what your method is, remove your phone from your room whilst doing it at all times. If you need your phone for the task you are doing, please, at the very least, turn all your notifications off.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, this works. If it motivates you to do your task more, feel free to treat yourself, just a bit, once you have fully completed it. Try not to overdo your treat, and please, only treat yourself when you genuinely think you deserve it.</p>

    <h2>2. NoFap</h2>
    <p>Alright, the second part of changing your life. Now, to do NoFap, you have to think of a strong enough reason to do it. Could be because of the shit feeling afterwards, could be because of the effects it has on your mental health (look it up if you need to), etc.</p>
    <p>Don't count the days. Developing "streaks" won't work. Just act like you don't do it all together. Instead of saying "I'm trying to quit, I've been on NoFap for (x) days", just say you don't do it. Also, remember: it's not a relapse if you learn something from it. </p>
    <p>Spend your spare time doing productive things. Exercising, hanging out with friends, pursuing a hobby, are all great things to be doing instead.</p>
    <p>You will get the urge at some point. When that does happen, write it down, and as well as that, write down what triggered you into it. The urge will most likely come from sitting in your room alone. So, I know this sounds very inconvenient, but don't sit around in your room during the day without a valid reason, and just telling you, scrolling on social media is not a valid reason.</p>
    <p>If you get the urge for whatever reason and none of this works, do some push ups, and if you're too tired to, then you should be too tired to jerk off. So, go to sleep.</p>

    <h2>3. Quit Vaping</h2>
    <p>If you don't vape, which is probably most of you guys, scroll down to the next step. If you do, keep reading.</p>
    <p>First thing is, why do you vape? If you do it because your friends do it, stop being friends with them. Their idiots who are going to get lung cancer from this stupid shit. If you are doing it because of depression or anxiety, see a therapist if you have the money, otherwise, talk to your family and friends about it. Some alternatives can also be gum, fruit, doing pushups, etc.</p>
    <p>If it helps, remember what this does to you. If you don't know, google it.</p>

    <h2>4. Stop Scrolling 24/7</h2>
    <p>Get your phone for a second, go to settings, and check your screen time. If it is above 3 hours a day, that's already a decade of your life wasted on your phone if you continue this, assuming you'll live until the age of 90. So, I want you to try and reduce your weekly average by 1 hour a day every week, and I will teach you how here.</p>
    <p>First step, turn off all notifications. You can leave call notifications on but that's it. You can tell your friends you're doing this if you need to, so they understand why you're giving them delayed responses.</p>
    <p>Second step, don't bring your phone around in public if necessary. Yes, I understand, if you need to have it whilst at some places, that's completely fine, but don't use it at those places if possible. Another piece of advice is to never have it in your room, as you will most likely mindlessly scroll on it. If you need it for an alarm or whatever, put it in a place where you can't go over and grab it, and speaking of which, have a bedtime routine. Here's one I'd recommend; go to bed at 10 pm and wake up at 7 am. Don't use any screens at all after 9 pm. During the hour between then and when you go to bed, write everything you remember about your day, get ready for bed, read, then go to bed.</p>
    <p>Instead of wasting your time consuming this garbage content all day, why don't you spend your time creating it instead? I have courses on how to do this, and it only costs $10.</p>
    <p>Before I wrap up this part, I'd recommend doing stuff like playing video games, watching TV, etc less. Of course, these things are alright in moderation, but it shouldn't be a regular thing. Instead, spend your time with family, friends, pursuing hobbies, etc.</p>

    <h2>5. Stop Eating Processed Shit</h2>
    <p>Stop eating for the pleasure of it a lot. Might sound hard, but remember this: you won't remember the taste the next day, will you? But will your body remember the calories? Yes, probably.</p>
    <p>Instead of eating processed bs, eat foods with protein in it, and fruits and vegetables. Work out the amount of food with protein you have a day, and the amount of fruit and veggies you have a day should be half of that. Oh yeah I'm not saying you can't have processed foods occasionally, but please limit it.</p>
    <p>Your diet isn't limited to what food you eat, it is also limited to what you drink. Next time you think of buying a coke or whatever, ask yourself: "Why am I getting this?". If it's for hydration, drink water, if it's for the taste, drink a fruit juice (preferably, drink water, but juice is still better than a coke), if it's too feel energised, drink coffee.</p>
    <p>Next time you go shopping, plan ahead. Instead of buying a packet of chips, buy a packet of nuts. Instead of getting lollies, buy fruit. Instead of buying an ice cream tub, buy yoghurt. You get the point, basically, just buy healthy alternatives.</p>
    <p>To end this bit off, having your favourite foods and whatever occasionally is fine, if it is in moderation. Also, when buying healthy foods, don't just choose the same thing everytime, or else you will get sick of the diet, and eventually give up.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Start Going to The Gym</h2>
    <p>Hopefully, you're wanting to either gain muscle or lose weight. Maybe both. Maybe you might just need something to do after a long day.</p>
    <p>I would highly recommend doing a sport as well, even if you already go to the gym. Choose whichever sport you want. That way, you can get your hour or 2 of exercise a day in. Now, that isn't my only reason, and in fact, it is just one of many. Other reasons include it boosts your confidence, concentration, gives you better sleep, etc.</p>
    <p>If you don't already have one, get a gym membership. If you can't afford one, then do around 100 pushups daily 5 days a week. Sounds like a lot, but you can spread it out throughout the day. Go for walks, runs, bike rides, etc regularly as well.</p>
    <p>If you have a gym membership, give yourself a 5 day gym routine. On the next guide, there will be one.</p>
    <p>If you are skinny and trying to gain weight, see cardio as your enemy. You can go for walks and bike rides occasionally, but avoid using the treadmill at the gym. If you are trying to lose weight, go on the treadmill at least once or twice a week.</p>
    <p>Also, if you have friends or family members that go to the same gym as you, definitely go with them.</p>
    <p>Remember, you won't get your ideal physique in a day. It'll probably take at least a month or two before you start making a lot of progress.</p>
    <p>If you are severely injured and/or you physically can't go to the gym, don't worry, I've been in the same situation, but as soon as you recover, work twice as hard as you were before you broke that bone and train the other muscles if possible.</p>

    <h2>7. Have at Least 3 Meals a Day</h2>
    <p>Pretty self explanatory, so I won't go on too much here, but make sure you are doing this. Even if you are trying to lose weight, that is not a valid reason to starve yourself.</p>

    <h2>8. Drink Water</h2>
    <p>90%, if not more, of the liquid you consume should be water. Aim for around 2-3L of water a day. Remember, you need water to survive, meanwhile, you don't need any other drink to survive.</p>

    <h2>9. Don't Talk Negative About Yourself or Compare Yourself to Others</h2>
    <p>If you are always comparing yourself to others, you are always going to feel that they are better than you.<p>
    <p>You should only compare yourself To yourself. Strive to be better than who you were yesterday, not some random person online who doesn't know you exist.</p>
    <p>Ps; hating yourself doesn't motivate you, and if anything, it demotivates you, but being proud of yourself, if you don't overdo it, motivates you to keep going and be better.</p>
    <p>If it's a joke, it's not funny or whatever. Nobody actually laughs at those sorts of jokes anyways, so please, tell me, what do you gain from it?</p>
    <p>In summary, if you are doing well, believe you are doing well, and keep going. If you aren't doing well, think "what can I do about it?", and actually do something about it.</p>

    <h2>10. Don't Overdo Anything</h2>
    <p>Yes, you should be working hard, but you deserve a rest. This doesn't mean going back to your old bad habits again, but you deserve to relax. Of course, if you own a business, you obviously need to check on it daily, but you deserve to have fun in life.</p>
    <p>Hopefully, this guide works for you. It requires discipline, as you have to make the decisions yourself. Anyways, best of luck, and feel free to join our <a href="https://discord.gg/tKCRqBvzWD">discord server</a> to talk with people in the transformyourlife community, and ask them any questions.</p>
    <p>Once you have quit your bad habits, which should hopefully not take more than a day to a week. Once you are free from your addictions, scroll down to the second part of this guide.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>How To Get Positive Habits</h1>
    <p>Alright, so now that you have broken free from your addictions, you probably have a lot more time on your hands. This is great, as it means you have a lot more time for new and better habits.</p>

    <h2>1. Start Doing Daily Exercise</h2>
    <p>Not saying you have to be in the gym everyday of the week, you should have rest days as well, but on those rest days, you should still be doing some sort of exercise. Could be a sport you really like, could be going for a run (if you are trying to lose weight), could be going for a bike ride, could be going to the beach, etc. Make sure you are exercising for at least an hour or 2 a day as well.</p>
    <p>If you have a daily routine, add going to the gym and sport as part of it. If you don't have one, I'd highly recommend making one. Make exercise something you do right after school/work.</p>
    <p>For the gym, have a workout plan. Here is the one I use, and would recommend you use too:</p>
    <p>Day 1: Chest and back</p>
    <p>Day 2: Arms and shoulder</p>
    <p>Day 3: Abs and legs</p>
    <p>Day 4: Arms and shoulders</p>
    <p>Day 5: Chest and back</p>
    <p>On my 2 rest days, I usually like to go for a bike ride or walk. It's nice and relaxing, and you should try doing that too.</p>
    <p>If you miss a few days of the gym because of something like a holiday or whatever, it's not the end of the world, but try to eat as much protein as possible whilst on the holiday.</p>
    <p>The gym is very important, but so is diet. As one is useless without the other, the next part of this diet will talk about how to get a good diet.</p>

    <h2>2. Get a Better Diet</h2>
    <p>Eat fruits, vegetables, proteins, etc. That way, you gain muscle, rather than body fat.</p>
    <p>Limit sugar in foods and drinks. Of course, nowadays, sadly everything in shops contains sugar, which is why you should limit packaged shit. I'm not saying you need to completely avoid it, but try to look for healthier alternatives.</p>
    <p>Chicken and rice > Fast food</p>
    <p>Grilled chicken burger/sandwich > Processed burger</p>
    <p>Nuts > Processed chips</p>
    <p>Homemade meals > Takeaway</p>
    <p>Yoghurt > Ice cream</p>
    <p>Protein shakes > Milkshakes</p>
    <p>Water > Soda</p>
    <p>What I do is make my diet 80% the healthy alternatives, and 20% the other option. That way, the majority of my diet is healthy, but I can still eat junk food in moderation.</p>
    <p>Final advice is to make sure you have at least 3 meals and 2l of water a day. Even if you are trying to lose weight, that's not a reason to starve yourself.</p>

    <h2>3. Pray and Meditate Daily</h2>
    <p>As for praying, do it in the morning and before bed. Make sure you are in a quiet area when you do it. My suggestions would be your room or garden, if you have one. Say thank you to god for giving you another day, and don't just pray for your desires.</p>
    <p>As for meditating, also do it in a quiet area. Don't use some bs app or YouTube video, just do it quietly. Breathe in and out, and clear your mind while doing it. It's pretty simple, just sit in silence, on your bed, for 5-10 minutes a day, and don't think about anything whilst doing it.</p>

    <h2>4. Read Daily</h2>
    <p>Would recommend doing it at night. Remove all distractions, such as your phone, from your room whilst reading, and read books that interest you.</p>

    <h2>5. Set Daily Goals for Yourself</h2>
    <p>Write down a list of daily tasks each morning. Some examples are:</p>
    <u>
        <li>Have a cold shower</li>
        <br>
        <li>Take the dog for a walk</li>
        <br>
        <li>Don't use phone for more than 2 hours</li>
        <br>
        <li>Go to the gym for an hour</li>
        <br>
        <li>Meditate for 5 minutes</li>
        <br>
    </u>
    <p>These are just examples, not limits. Don't add too many things, as it will get overwhelming. Add roughly 5 things. If you forget to do one of your goals on one day, it's not the end of the world, but it's to be your priority the next day.</p>

    <h2>6. Have a Routine</h2>
    <p>You can use mine and change it up based on personal needs:</p>
    <p>7:00 am: Morning Routine</p>
    <p>8:00 am: School</p>
    <p>4:00 pm: Gym</p>
    <p>5:00 pm: Work on business</p>
    <p>9:00 pm: Journaling and reading</p>
    <p>10:00 pm: Bedtime</p>
    <p>This was made as part of Hamza's dopamine detox, which is a part of his <a href="skool.com/adonis-gang">adonis protocol</a>. It's free, and would definitely recommend joining.</p>
    <p>As for my "morning routine", I usually wake up, make myself breakfast and a cup of coffee, have a cold shower, get ready, respond to my notifications in the remaining time, and leave to go to school. And no, of course I don't spend all the time between 5 and 9 pm on my business. I eat dinner and stuff too.</p>

    <h2>7. Journaling</h2>
    <p>You can either do it in a notebook or on google docs. Do it at the end of each day, and write down everything you remember about the day. At the end, make a list of things that were good and things that were bad. For the good things, be grateful and thankful for them. For the bad things, think about why they were bad, and how you could prevent them. I'm not saying everythings preventable, but try to prevent what is preventable.</p>
    <p>Be completely honest when you are journaling. Instead of being sad about what happened, acknowledge it's the past, and prevent it from happening. We all make mistakes, nobody's perfect. The only person that will be reading the journal is you. Not me, not your parents, none of the kids at school, just you. When you are done writing it, read it, and reflect over it.</p>

    <h2>8. Live everyday like you may not wake up tomorrow</h2>
    <p>I'm sorry to scare you a bit, but 1/50,000 people die each day. This means that's the chance you won't wake up tomorrow. You should use the fear from this as a reason to work hard everyday, especially when you don't feel like it.</p>
    <p>Yes, you will most likely live for 80-90 years, but why waste this shit? Make your parents proud. They will not be proud of a lazy son/daughter, will they?</p>

    <h2>9. Have a good sleep schedule</h2>
    <p>Say goodbye to staying up late playing games with your friends. Even on weekend nights, you still have a day ahead of you. I'm not saying to cut out video games completely, but they aren't worth losing sleep over.</p>
    <p>Go to bed at 10 pm and wake up at 7 am. You can sleep in on weekends but don't make it a habit.</p>
    <p>If you want reasoning, better sleep makes you think better, less angry, be healthier physically, have a better memory, etc. If you don't believe me, google it.</p>

    <h2>10. Fix your social life</h2>
    <p>I'm going to assume at least one of these things are true:</p>
    <u>
        <li>You get bullied</li>
        <br>
        <li>You don't have a girlfriend</li>
        <br>
        <li>Your the only person in your friend group who's doing self improvement</li>
        <br>
    </u>
    <p>So, I am going to go over how you can fix these things.</p>
    <p>As for the first one, you are going to have to do something about it. If you are getting called "fat", you are going to have to lose weight, and once you are done, you are going to have to gain muscle. If you are getting called "skinny", you are going to have to gain muscle. I don't care if this is "offensive" or "toxic masculinity", it's the honest truth. You can either get a gym membership or keep getting bullied, your choice. Even if you aren't getting bullied because of your weight, you are still going to have to get stronger, otherwise, I can't help you. If you can't get a gym membership, do push-ups, squats, etc. Just think about why you are getting bullied, and what you can do about it.</p>
    <p>It's the same with finding a girlfriend. Think about why you don't have one and what you can do about it. As well as this, start being more social. There's a saying “never go grocery shopping while you are hungry, because you will just grab whatever you can, all because you are hungry”. Don't look for girls while you are lonely. Make a few good friends first. You also need to be confident and actually talk to girls. If there's a girl in one of your classes, you could ask her about the homework or something. Each time you do that, you get a bit more confident when talking to girls. Also, don't try to be one of the "cool kids" at school who vape and shit just to get girls. Sure, some of them may have a hot girlfriend, but her personality is more important than her looks. I will finish this paragraph with a quote "If you chase butterflies, they will fly away. But if you build a beautiful garden, the butterflies will come."</p>
    <p>As for the last part, all I can say is start talking to them about self improvement. Ask them to go to the gym with you, send them self improvement videos, etc. If your friends are asking you to vape with them, asking you to stay up late playing video games with them, etc, either try to get them out of these habits or stop being friends with them all together. Have friends that actually have goals in life.</p>

    <h2>11. Start a side hustle</h2>
    <p>My recommendation is to do content creation. Start doing videos on something that is popular, but change it up a bit. Instead of making regular fun facts videos, do fact videos on a particular topic. Instead of doing regular reddit story videos, add AI images to them. Also, make a business somewhat relevant to your account. My recommendation would be a clothing brand, as this business also has one. I am working on a full guide on this stuff, and it will be out soon.</p>

    <h2>12. Take cold showers</h2>
    <p>They are good for removing acne. I usually have them in the mornings and sometimes after workouts. However, don't have them before sleep, as they make you more awake at night.</p>

    <h2>13. Spend time with family and friends</h2>
    <p>These people won't always be there. Your relationships with these people are more important than anything. Any amount of money, any amount of anything. Make them proud, and spend time with them.</p>

    <h2>14. Do what you love</h2>
    <p>Now, don't take this in the wrong way. By "what you love", I mean stuff like hobbies. Scrolling on social media, jerking off, partying, etc aren't hobbies. Do stuff like playing an instrument, sport, coding, or whatever actually interests you.</p>

    <h2>15. Accepting Failure</h2>
    <p>So, let's say you start an online business, and it fails. Acknowledge the fact you've actually failed for starters. We've all failed at some point in life. Think about why you failed, and how you could prevent it. Even do a little research on it so it doesn't happen again. Work twice as hard next time.</p>
