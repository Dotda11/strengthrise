  <h1>Self Improvement Guide: Goal Setting, Task/Time Management, Spirituality and Productivity</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>1. Goal Setting</h2>
  <p>Write down roughly 4-6 goals you want to achieve on a piece of paper. Make sure they are specific and something worth dedicating a lot of time (months, maybe even years) towards. Here are some examples:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Do 100kg bench press in the gym</li>
    <li>Lose 10kg or gain 5kg</li>
    <li>Quit a bad habit (drugs, porn, etc)</li>
    <li>Learn/get better at a skill</li>
    <li>Make $10k/m</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These are just examples, use your own goals for this. Think about why you chose this goal. As well, try not to make all your goals about you. Try to make some of the goals about things to do with other people too. Some examples could be retiring your parents, helping your friend achieve one of their goals, etc.</p>
  <p>Write down your progress on all of your chosen goals everyday, even if you haven't made any. Make sure your chosen goals are priorities. If you fail trying to achieve your goals, that is completely fine, just get back up and try again if you fall down.</p>
  <p>The reason you need goals is so you become more disciplined and most importantly, so you have things to actually focus on.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>2. Task/Time management</h2>
  <p>Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorise tasks; The most important tasks/tasks you'll do first, the important but less important tasks/tasks you'll do after, tasks that aren't that important and tasks you don't even need to worry about. Now, add a fifth category: tasks you should avoid at all costs. Could be an addiction you're trying to quit. Make sure you remove all things triggering yourself from this, and that you are disciplined enough to face it.</p>
  <p>Always plan out your day the night beforehand. That way, you are more prepared for it and you don't have to worry as much.</p>
  <p>This is optional, but I'd recommend following a routine. You can have different routines for different days as well. I will leave this bit up to you.</p>
  <p>Also, when you are working (not at your job, I mean when you are at home), use the Pomodoro Technique; Work for 25 minutes, relax for 5, repeat until you are done.</p>
  <h2>3. Spirituality</h2>
